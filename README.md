# Chess
This project implements a Python-based chess capture validator, allowing users to input a white chess piece and up to 16 black pieces, then determining which black pieces can be captured based on chess movement rules.

Key Features:
♟️ Users input a white piece (choice between two predefined pieces) and its position.
♟️ Users add black pieces one by one (minimum 1, maximum 16).
♟️ The program validates inputs and provides feedback on any errors.
♟️ Once all pieces are placed, it evaluates and displays capturable black pieces.

This project highlights input validation, rule-based logic, and user interaction while emphasizing real-world problem-solving skills in programming.
